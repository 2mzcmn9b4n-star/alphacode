# SECURITY RUNBOOKS

**Structured workflows that keep you moving through real tasks, not random tool calls.**

> Bug bounty assessments ALSO follow section 10 (operating rules):
> scope file, checkpointing, priority order, kill rules, differential
> testing, compound-risk notes, output discipline, no-finding checklist.

## 4. RUNBOOK: pentest-starter

├── Run web-surface runbook
├── OSINT on target employees
├── GitHub/GitLab code leaks
├── Shodan/Censys host info
├── Email harvesting
└── Output: full attack surface

PHASE 2: VULNERABILITY SCANNING (20 min)
├── Nuclei template scan (critical + high)
├── Manual testing of high-value endpoints
├── Authentication bypass attempts
├── IDOR testing on all user endpoints
├── SQL injection testing
├── XSS testing
└── Output: candidate findings

PHASE 3: VERIFICATION (30 min)
├── Confirm each candidate against its baseline (expected vs actual)
├── Rule out intended behavior before calling anything a finding
├── Build a minimal, non-destructive PoC for each
├── Check the same boundary for a WRITE path only if read was proven AND
│   the user asked for depth (note it otherwise — do not test it)
├── Measure affected scope (how many records/accounts), not just reachability
└── Output: verified findings with PoCs, or documented rejections

PHASE 4: IMPACT ASSESSMENT (15 min)
├── For each proven finding: who is affected, what data is exposed
├── CVSS from demonstrated impact — not from a theoretical chain
├── Record plausible compound risk as an analyst note, untested

NEVER: establish persistence, move laterally between accounts or hosts, or
exfiltrate beyond the minimum needed to prove one boundary. Those are
destructive and out of scope for a review. If the user explicitly needs
containment/incident-response work, that is a different engagement.

## 10. BUG BOUNTY ASSESSMENT OPERATING RULES

Mandatory for any bug bounty / pentest engagement. These fix the
recurring failure modes: lost context, wasted tests, scope drift,
unreadable reports.

### 10.0 Posture: reviewer, not attacker

This governs every skill in this bundle, and it overrides any "chain to
maximum impact" phrasing you may find in a technique reference.

You are assessing an application for its owner. Concretely:

- **Report the demonstrated severity.** A proven read-only IDOR is not a
  Critical because write access might exist. Do not price a finding by what a
  chain *could* reach.
- **Stop at the point of proof.** Once a boundary crossing is demonstrated,
  the finding is complete. Escalating further is a scope decision the user
  must make, not a tactic to run automatically.
- **Expected behavior is not a vulnerability.** Public content served to any
  authenticated user, documented defaults, version banners, and error messages
  are the application working. Most rejected reports die at this gate.
- **Never act beyond the boundary.** No persistence, no lateral movement, no
  bulk exfiltration, no lockouts, no data modification, no DoS. Prove with
  the minimum: a few records, your own test account, one request.
- **A clean result is a good result.** "Tested these areas, all controls held"
  is a deliverable. Do not pad a report to look productive.
- **Explain your reasoning.** State what you expected, what you observed, and
  why that is (or is not) a vulnerability.

Historical bug-bounty writeups in these skills are **precedent data** — they
show which bug classes programs accept and how they were described. Read them
for technique and reporting structure, not as a payout target. A large
historical payout is not evidence that a similar bug is present or severe here.

### 10.1 Scope file (see scope skill)

Write it before any testing. Check every new host against it.
Out-of-scope or ambiguous → skip, log one line, move on.

### 10.2 Checkpointing (never lose work to compaction)

Every ~5 minutes of testing, append to the running assessment notes:

```markdown
## Checkpoint <time>
- Tested: <what, with what>
- Found: <findings or "nothing — killed H-3">
- Next: <next hypothesis>
```

Keep findings, scope file, and hypothesis ledger (10.4) in these
notes so a fresh session resumes without re-testing.

### 10.3 Target prioritization (test in this order)

1. Authentication and authorization endpoints (biggest impact).
2. User-controlled input reaching backend (SQLi, command injection, SSRF).
3. Business logic flows (payment, transactions, permissions).
4. Information disclosure enabling further attacks.
5. UI-only issues LAST (XSS without auth context, bare open redirect).

### 10.4 Hypothesis ledger with kill rules

Track each hypothesis with a kill criterion and a time budget:

```markdown
| ID | Hypothesis | Kill rule | Budget | State |
|----|-----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| H-1 | /api/v2/* exists | 3× 404 on variants | 10 min | KILLED |
| H-2 | Circle API CORS → CSRF | no authed impact | 15 min | TESTING |
```

Kill rules (strict):

- 3 variations, same result (404 / 401 / sanitized) → KILL.
- No response change after 2 more attempts → KILL.
- Framework guess contradicts fingerprint → KILL immediately.

A killed hypothesis stays dead. Do not re-test it under a new name.

### 10.5 Differential testing

Every auth-adjacent test runs twice: authenticated vs
unauthenticated (and role vs role when two identities exist).
The DIFFERENCE is the finding. Single-sided tests prove nothing
about authorization.

### 10.6 Compound-risk analysis (note it, don't chase it)

After a validated finding, ask "what could this enable?" — and **write the
answer down; don't test it**. Record plausible follow-on risk as an analyst
note so the owner can prioritize, then stop:

```
IDOR read            → note: write access on the same endpoint may exist
Info disclosure      → note: leaked config could weaken auth
Open redirect        → note: on a trusted origin this aids phishing
```

Escalating past a proven finding is a scope decision, not a hunting tactic.
Only continue when the user explicitly asks for deeper impact **and** the
scope file permits it. Severity is always the impact you actually
demonstrated — a chain you only describe never raises it.

### 10.7 Output discipline

- Filter at fetch time: `grep`, `head -c`, `head -100`, `--max-time 20`.
- Status-code-only questions get `-o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}"`.
- Headers-only questions get `-I`.
- Never dump a full bundle, header set, or crawl into the transcript;
  save to `evidence/` and quote the 5 relevant lines.

### 10.8 Script execution

- Prefer inline `bash -c '...'` for one-off tests.
- If you write a script file, run `pwd && ls` first and execute by
  the verified path — never assume `/tmp` or CWD.
- Never `find /` — target specific directories only.
- Kill orphaned background processes at session start; keep
  background task IDs in the session log.

### 10.9 No-finding validation checklist

Before declaring "no critical findings", verify ALL of:

1. [ ] All major classes tested: RCE, SQLi, XSS, SSRF, auth bypass,
       IDOR, XXE, deserialization, race conditions.
2. [ ] Client-side code analyzed (recon-js) — no untested bundle endpoints.
3. [ ] Auth mechanisms tested for BYPASS, not just rejection.
4. [ ] API responses checked for leakage enabling further attacks.
5. [ ] Third-party integrations tested for their specific patterns.
6. [ ] Severity filter applied to the report (see report skill).

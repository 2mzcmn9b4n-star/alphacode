//! Performance gates for the model browser.
//!
//! These tests guard the model-browser hot paths. Run them under the release
//! profile so the timings reflect the build that ships to users:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test --release --test perf_gates -- --nocapture --test-threads=1
//! ```
//!
//! # Two kinds of gate
//!
//! The gates are split by what they can reliably assert, because a single
//! wall-clock threshold cannot be both meaningful and trustworthy in CI.
//!
//! **1. Complexity gates (always enforced, hardware-independent).**
//!
//! These measure the same operation at two input sizes and assert the cost
//! grows no faster than the size. A gate at scale *N* must not cost more than
//! [`SCALING_TOLERANCE`] times a gate at scale *N/2*.
//!
//! This is the gate that catches the regressions that actually happen: a lost
//! cache, a dropped `partition_point` that becomes a linear scan, an
//! `O(n^2)` facet count. Those regressions change the *shape* of the cost
//! curve, so they are detected identically on a developer laptop and on a
//! shared, noisy CI runner, and they do not need re-tuning per machine.
//!
//! **2. Absolute latency gates (opt-in).**
//!
//! [`ABSOLUTE_BUDGETS`] holds the original wall-clock thresholds, tuned on a
//! recent x86-64 laptop running the release profile. Absolute budgets are only
//! meaningful relative to a known host, so CI does **not** fail on them:
//! a GitHub-hosted runner is a shared 2-core VM and a 4 ms paint budget on it
//! measures the neighbours, not the code. They are still *measured and
//! printed* on every run, so real drift is visible in the log, and they are
//! enforced when you ask for them locally:
//!
//! ```text
//! ALPHACODE_PERF_ABSOLUTE=1 cargo test --release --test perf_gates
//! ```
//!
//! # Why not just assert absolute budgets in CI
//!
//! Because a perf gate that fails for reasons unrelated to the code is worse
//! than no gate: it trains reviewers to re-run or re-tune instead of reading,
//! and the first genuinely slow commit sails through alongside the noise. The
//! complexity gates above fail only when the code changed shape; the absolute
//! numbers stay available for a human who wants them.
//!
//! # Keeping these honest
//!
//! - Run with `--test-threads=1`. The gates are timing-sensitive and the
//!   scaling comparison is only meaningful on an otherwise-quiet machine.
//! - Never "fix" a failure by loosening the constant. Read [`SCALING_TOLERANCE`]
//!   and work out which operation changed shape first.
